# Saliency-Detection-on-Multi-feature-
This is a program of Saliency Detection based on multi-feature distribution and maximum likelihood estiation.
The experimental data have been compressed, please uncompress the .zip files first. 
The file saliencymaps.zip is too big to upload, please download from:
http://ivrlwww.epfl.ch/supplementary_material/RK_CVPR09/saliencymaps.zip

Then decompress the file to this program directly.
